[TakeShape](https://www.takeshape.io/) provides instant, intuitive, adaptable, and collaborative services to power Jamstack projects of any size, shape, or complexity.

In this guide, you will discover how to create a [TakeShape blog](https://next-blog-takeshape.now.sh/), and deploy it with [<ProductName />](/).

## Step 1: Setting Up with TakeShape

Firstly, create a free [TakeShape account](https://app.takeshape.io/signup) and set up a Blank Project.

From the project settings page on the TakeShape Dashboard, create an **Author** model by selecting "Add Content Type", using "Author" as the title.

When settings up the Author model, add two widgets, **Single Line** with the title "Name", and **Asset** with the title "Picture".

Once you have added the required widgets, click "Create Content Type" to save the model.

Click the "Add Content Type" button again to create a **Post** model with the title "Post".

Add the following widgets with their corresponding titles:

- **Single Line** - "Title", marked as required.
- **Markdown** - "Content".
- **Single Line** - "Excerpt", marked as required.
- **Asset** - "Cover Image", marked as required.
- **Date** - "Date".
- **Single Line** - "Slug".
- **Relationship** - "Author", with **Relationship Type** set to "Single".

Once you have added the required widgets, click "Create Content Type" to save the model.

## Step 2: Adding Your TakeShape Content

Select the **Author** Content Type, then create an **Author** record using your name and select an image from the ones provided. If you like, you can use a custom image by uploading it to your TakeShape asset library.

Next, create multiple **Post** records, completing the fields where prompted. Make sure to choose the **Author** created previously, you can also use [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) for the **Content** field.

## Step 3: Set Up Your Next.js Blog

Set up a Next.js project by Initializing the [project template](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/cms-takeshape) and moving into the project directory:

<Snippet width="100%"dark text="yarn create next-app --example cms-takeshape my-takeshape-app && cd my-takeshape-app" />

## Step 4: Creating Your API Keys

For your app to function correctly, you will need to provide it with 3 environment variables.

<Note>
  You will need to set these environment variables when importing the project
  into Vercel as well.
</Note>

Create an `.env.local` file at the root of the project and add the key values using the instructions below, replacing the placeholders with the values and removing the brackets.

Your `.env.local` file will look like this:

```bash
TAKESHAPE_API_KEY=[API_KEY]
TAKESHAPE_PROJECT_ID=[PROJECT_ID]
TAKESHAPE_PREVIEW_SECRET=[PREVIEW_SECRET]
```

  variables to the app during development.

### `TAKESHAPE_API_Key`

From the TakeShape Dashboard, create an API with the **Read** permission.

### `TAKESHAPE_PROJECT_ID`

You can find your project `id` in the URL from the TakeShape dashboard, it will look similar to `a17a8efa-372e-4969-9267-55a9c35a0907`.

### `TAKESHAPE_PREVIEW_SECRET`

Create a random string that can be used as a preview secret. You can use a string similar to `MY_SECRET`, but remember to change it to make it unique.

## Step 5: Deploying Your Blog with <NameWrapper name={PRODUCT_NAME} />

<DeploySection meta={meta} />

export default ({ children }) => <Guide meta={meta}>{children}</Guide>

export const config = {
  amp: 'hybrid'
}
