When making changes to DNS records it can take time for these to propagate fully. This means waiting for DNS providers to recognise the change globally and different record types can take longer to update than others.

## Nameserver Changes

If you have changed the nameservers with your current domain registrar then it usually takes up to 48 hours for these to be reflected globally. This is not something that Vercel have any control over and for certain registrars, this can can slower.

Once nameservers have been changed, you may wish to check the progress of the propagation. There are many third-party tools that do this, such as [DNS Checker](https://dnschecker.org/) and [DNS Map](https://dnsmap.io/) - these show the state of your DNS records in different regions of the world.

You can also use the terminal to check the nameservers for your domain according by specific DNS providers, some examples are found below:

### Other Records

The following records should propagate in a few minutes or seconds:

- **MX**
- **TXT**
- **A**
- **AAAA**
- **CNAME**
- **SRV**
- **ALIAS**
- **CAA**

Therefore, you can query these records usually within minutes after adding them:

You can check the propagation progress of these records for your domain with third-party tools like [DNS Checker](https://dnschecker.org/) and [DNS Map](https://dnsmap.io/) in the same way you can for nameservers.

You can also use the terminal to check the these records for your domain according by specific DNS providers, some examples are found below:
